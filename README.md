# PyBer_Analysis

PyBer is a ride-sharing app company that is valued at $2.3 billion. For this project, we have been tasked with analyzing all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and creating a compelling visualization for the CEO of the company. 

## Overview of Analysis

For this new project, using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib, we have been tasked to run additional analysis focusing primarly on two areas in particular... 
  - Comparing the total number of rides, total number of drivers and the total amount of fares for all three city types (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) to cacluate  the average fare per driver for each city type. 
  - Reviewing the total fares for each week during the specified time frame by city type.
 
## Analysis  Results

Using the data provided, we are able to visually compare to total number of rides, the total number of drivers, the total amount of fares in US Dollars, the average fare per ride, and the average fare per driver in the three city types (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) during the January 2019 - May 2019 time frame.

We can see urban cities account for the greatest total number of rides, drivers, and fares while having the lowest average in fares per ride and per driver. 
Comparatively, we can also see that rural cities account for the lowest total number of rides, drivers, and fares while having the highest average of fares per ride and per driver with suburban cities falling in the middle.

### Breakdown (Total number of rides, Total number of drivers, Total amount of fares)
In the image below, you will find a comparsion of the total number of rides broken down per city type in percentage form.

As with the table presented above, we can see that the largest number of total rides come from urban cities accounting for more than 2/3 of the total rides during the specified time frame in 2019. Suburban areas account for over 26% of the total rides and rural cities have the smallest proportion with only for 5.3%

In the image below, you will find a comparison of the total number of drivers broken down per city type in percentage form.

As with the table presented above, we can confirm that urban cities drivers were by far in majority with 80.9% of the company's drivers force during the specified time frame in 2019. Surbuban and rural drivers were respectively 26.3% and 5.3% of the total drivers in 2019, confirming rural cities with the lowest percentage of total drivers.

In the image below, you will find a comparision of the total amount of fares in USD broken down per city type in percentage form.

Likewise, with this chart, we can see once again that the urban cities account for the largest amount of fares during the specified time frame with 62.7% ($39,854.38) of the total amount of fares. We can see as well that rural cities has the smallest percentage of the total fares with suburban cities falling in the middle. 

### Total Fare by City Type

In the image below, you will find a comparson of the total fare amount for each city type.

Based on this chart, we can see an alternative view of the total fares for all three city types with urban cities bringing in the most funds for the company. We also see an upward spike in total fares for all three cities around Feburary 24th.

## Summary

Based on the data analysis we can see a few key points...
  - Pyber is most profitable in the urban cities. While urban cities report the lowest fares in comparison to rural and suburban cities, the amount of rides given in these urban cities allow for lower prices and increased number of drivers. 
  - Rural cities account for the highest fares but have both fewer drivers and fewer recorded rides. More research can be conducted to analysis the reason behind this pattern as to provide more options and more competitve fares for those individuals in the rural areas. Research into the technological barriers may be of particular focus as PyBer is a ride-sharing app. Typically rural cities do not have the same access to cellular towers and thus could be part of the reason for the reduced number of rides. Likewise, individuals in rural cities are typically lower-income so that may also be a barrier. A deeper level of research can tease out some of these topics. 
  - Suburban cities fall in the middle in all areas. If PyBer would like to increase the profitability in these areas, more research will need to be conducted to analysis this pattern of ride-share behavior.
